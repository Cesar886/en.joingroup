        <p>Are you new to Clash Royale and unsure which clan to join? Or have you been playing for a while and want a more competitive clan? Whatever your level, choosing the <strong>right clan based on your experience</strong> is key to progressing in the game.</p>

        <h2>Why look for clans based on your level?</h2>
        <p>Not all clans are the same. Some focus on teaching newbies, others are casual and just play for fun, and some are competitive where every war counts. In <a href="/clanes/clanes-de-clash-royale">our dedicated section</a>, you can filter clans by:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Beginners:</strong> clans to learn, get tips, and receive lots of donations.</li>
        <li><strong>Intermediate players:</strong> active clans with goals, but not too demanding.</li>
        <li><strong>Competitive:</strong> organized clans that participate in clan wars and aim for rankings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Clans for beginners</h2>
        <p>If you‚Äôre just starting out, it's best to join a clan with patient players willing to help. On <a href="/clanes">Joingroups</a> you can find many clans with descriptions like "we help new players" or "guaranteed donations." You can also read this article about the <a href="/blog/mejores-clanes-para-novatos">best clans for beginners</a>.</p>

        <h2>Clans for intermediate players</h2>
        <p>Once you have some experience, you‚Äôll want to progress faster. Look for clans that are active in wars but not overly strict. You can explore them on our <a href="/clanes">main page</a> or filter specifically in <a href="/clanes/clanes-de-clash-royale">clans by level</a>.</p>

        <h2>Competitive clans</h2>
        <p>If you're already in Arena 15 or higher, it's time to join a competitive clan. Here, strategy, coordination, and commitment matter. These clans usually have requirements like a minimum trophy count or weekly war participation. You can find some in our <a href="/clanes/clanes-de-clash-royale">top clans section</a>.</p>

        <h2>Do you have your own clan?</h2>
        <p>If you‚Äôre a leader or co-leader of a clan, you can <a href="/clanes/publicar-clan">publish it on Joingroups</a> so that players of your level can find it. It‚Äôs free and super easy, and your clan will appear in our featured searches.</p>

        <h2>You can also explore:</h2>

    description: 'Avoid wasting time and resources by joining inactive clans or clans that don‚Äôt fit your play style.',
    content: `
        <p>Choosing a clan in Clash Royale might seem easy, but there are common mistakes that can make you waste time and miss out on the benefits of team play. Here are the most frequent ones so you can avoid them.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 1: Joining an inactive clan</h2>
        <p>One of the most frequent mistakes is joining a clan with few active members. This limits donations, war participation, and overall interaction. Always check the activity on <a href="/clanes">our platform</a> before deciding.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 2: Not checking the clan requirements</h2>
        <p>Many clans have minimum requirements like trophy count or war participation. Not reading these rules can lead to kicks or frustration.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 3: Ignoring language or time zone</h2>
        <p>If you don‚Äôt speak the clan‚Äôs language or don‚Äôt match play times, communication and coordination will be difficult.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 4: Overlooking the clan description and goals</h2>
        <p>Some clans focus on competition, others are casual. Choose one that matches your expectations and style. In <a href="/clanes/clanes-de-clash-royale">this section</a> you can filter based on that.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 5: Not publishing your clan if you‚Äôre a leader</h2>
        <p>If you lead a clan, not publishing it on <a href="/clanes/publicar-clan">Joingroups</a> reduces your chances to attract new members.</p>

        <h2>Final tips</h2>
        <p>Always research before joining or publishing. Explore the variety of clans on <a href="/clanes">our platform</a>, filter by level, activity, and region, and choose wisely to make the most of your Clash Royale experience.</p>

        description: 'Is it better to have a full clan or a smaller, more organized one?',
        content: `
            <p>One of the most common debates among Clash Royale players is what the ideal clan size is. Should a clan always be full of members, or is it better to have fewer but more committed players? The answer depends on several factors, but here we give you all the information so you can make the best decision.</p>

            <h2>The maximum allowed: 50 members</h2>
            <p>Clash Royale allows clans to have up to 50 members, and many choose to fill all the spots to increase numerical strength in wars and donations.</p>

            <h3>Advantages of a full clan</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Greater donation capacity:</strong> With more active members, donations are usually abundant and quick.</li>
            <li><strong>More players for wars and tournaments:</strong> Makes it easier to form competitive and varied teams.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic environment:</strong> The variety of players can make the clan more active and diverse.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Disadvantages of a full clan</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Less control and cohesion:</strong> It's harder to maintain discipline and a good atmosphere.</li>
            <li><strong>Higher member turnover:</strong> There may be more inactivity and frequent changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Less sense of community:</strong> Some players may feel less connected.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Advantages of a small and organized clan</h2>
            <p>Clans with fewer but well-selected members tend to stand out for their cohesion and commitment. They can maintain strict rules and a more family-like atmosphere.</p>

            <h3>Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Better communication:</strong> They coordinate better for wars and events.</li>
            <li><strong>Greater commitment:</strong> Members tend to be more active and loyal.</li>
            <li><strong>Friendlier atmosphere:</strong> Toxicity and conflicts are avoided.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What size is best for you?</h2>
            <p>If you're looking for speed and variety, a full clan is the way to go. If you prefer quality and a good atmosphere, a smaller one might be better. On <a href="/clanes">Joingroups</a> you can find clans of all sizes and styles to choose the one that suits you best.</p>

            <h3>Tips for choosing the ideal clan</h3>
